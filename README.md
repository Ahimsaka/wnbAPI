# wnbAPI

This project utilized the same backend API that powers searches on stats.wnba.com to scrape and process data for WNBA games, players, and teams. It included pandas integration, and some basic tools for automating generation of interactive shot chart svgs. 

The WNBA stats API was revised after the project's most recent commit, so it is no longer expected to work. There are no plans to refactor.

This file is a placeholder in acknowledgement of the 
fact that more advanced tests will be needed
before this package is complete. The current
testing is sufficient to ensure that all classes
are functioning as designed, and that all methods
are returning data of *some* kind from the correct
endpoint. 

Advanced testing should ensure that the expected
data is returned by specific searches. 

Ideally advanced testing will also test
individual params to ensure that params affect the
returned data in ways that match expectations for
each endpoint.
